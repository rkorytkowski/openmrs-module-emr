/**
 * <pre>
 * API methods related to Admission, Discharge, and Transfer
 *
 * Since patients frequently leave the facility without having any formal electronic check-out process, we ensure that
 * old stale visits are automatically closed, even if they are never intentionally stopped. Our business logic is built
 * on the idea of <em>active</em> visits, per #isActive(Visit, Date). A visit with stopDatetime==null is not necessarily
 * active from our perspective. Non-active visits are liable to be stopped at any time.
 *
 * Visits are only allowed to happen at locations tagged with the EmrConstants.LOCATION_TAG_SUPPORTS_VISITS tag. When
 * you pass a location without that tag to a service method, we look from that location and above in the location
 * hierarchy until we find a location with this tag. (This allows you to configure the setup such that doing a check-in
 * at Outpatient Department creates a visit at its parent, with an Encounter at the location itself.)
